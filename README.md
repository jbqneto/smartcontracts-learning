# Solidity Smart Contracts – Learning Playground

This repository is a **personal learning playground** for studying and practicing **Ethereum smart contracts using Solidity**, with a strong focus on fundamentals.

At this stage, the project is intentionally simple and uses **Remix IDE** only.  
The goal is to build a solid foundation before moving to frameworks like Hardhat or Foundry.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn Solidity syntax and core concepts
- Understand contract structure, storage, and execution
- Practice writing and testing smart contracts using Remix
- Build small, isolated examples (no production intent)

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Solidity** (>=0.7.0 <0.9.0)
- **Remix IDE** (browser-based)
- **Remix Solidity Test Framework**
- **Hardhat Console (via Remix)**

---

## 🧪 Testing

Tests are written directly in Solidity using Remix's built-in testing framework.

Example:
- `Ballot_test.sol` validates proposal creation, voting, and winner selection.

Tests are executed directly inside Remix.

---

## 🚧 Non-Goals (for now)

- No deployment scripts
- No Hardhat / Foundry
- No frontend
- No mainnet/testnet deployments

This repository is **purely educational**.

---

## 🗺 Roadmap (Future)

- Migrate to Hardhat or Foundry
- Add JavaScript/TypeScript tests
- Introduce deployment scripts
- Integrate with a simple frontend
- Explore security patterns and gas optimizations
